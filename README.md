## General Information

The purpose of this task was to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with an Apollo Server. This app is built using the MERN stack. It was already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. This task involved the following:

- Setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
- Modifying RESTful API authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
- Created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

## Installation
